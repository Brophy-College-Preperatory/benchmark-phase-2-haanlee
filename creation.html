            <p>In 1948... </p>
               <p>The First In-N-Out Burger Opens:</p>

Every day before dawn, Harry visits the meat and produce markets to pick out fresh ingredients, which he prepares by hand. Meanwhile, his wife Esther diligently takes care of all the accounting for the new restaurant at their home right around the corner.</p>

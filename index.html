                In-N-Out is a popular American fast-food chain known for its fresh, high-quality burgers, fries, and shakes. Founded in 1948 in Baldwin Park, California, it has become a cult favorite with a loyal following, particularly on the West Coast. The menu is simple, featuring a few core items, but it also has "secret menu" options that are beloved by regulars. In-N-Out is renowned for using fresh, never frozen ingredients and maintaining a commitment to quality over mass expansion.</p>
